# nodemailer for send mail

In here I use [ethereal.mail](https://ethereal.email/) for test.
Go to [ethereal.mail](https://ethereal.email/) and `Create ethereal account`. 
use `username` and `password` from there to test your nodemailer <br>

and change this part.
```
auth : {
    user: 'lvkm6knprvrpg35p@ethereal.email',
    pass: 'BTtqMNWFmtysREwNMU'
}
```
change `lvkm6knprvrpg35p@ethereal.email` with your username from etherial.mail. <br>
change `BTtqMNWFmtysREwNMU` with your password from ethereal.mail. also
